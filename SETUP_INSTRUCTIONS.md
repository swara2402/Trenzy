# Setup Instructions for Protected Routes, Checkout, and Order Management

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Protected Routes
- ✅ Created `ProtectedRoute` component that checks authentication
- ✅ Applied to `/checkout`, `/profile`, `/orders`, and `/order-success/:orderId`
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to login with return URL
- ✅ Login page now redirects back to the original page after login

### 2. Complete Checkout Form
- ✅ Full address form with all required fields
- ✅ Payment method selection (Cash on Delivery, UPI, Credit/Debit Card)
- ✅ Order summary display
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Order placement functionality

### 3. Order Management System
- ✅ Order creation with unique order IDs
- ✅ Order storage functions (`createOrder`, `getUserOrders`, `getOrderById`, `cancelOrder`)
- ✅ Orders page displays orders
- ✅ Order cancellation functionality
- ✅ Order success page with order details

## 🗄️ Database Setup

This project uses **MongoDB** for data storage. The backend connects to MongoDB using the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

### Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
```

### MongoDB Collections

The backend automatically creates the following collections:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `products` - Product catalog

Orders are stored locally in the browser's localStorage for simplicity.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Checkout Flow
1. User adds items to cart
2. Clicks "Checkout" → Redirected to `/checkout` (protected)
3. If not logged in → Redirected to `/login` → After login → Back to `/checkout`
4. User fills address form and selects payment method
5. Clicks "Place Order" → Order saved to localStorage
6. Cart cleared → Redirected to `/order-success/:orderId`

### Order Management
- Users can view all their orders at `/orders`
- Each order shows:
  - Order ID
  - Order date
  - Payment method
  - Status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
  - Items with quantities
  - Total price
  - Shipping address
- Users can cancel orders (if status allows)

## 📝 Notes

- Orders are stored locally in the browser
- Order IDs are generated as: `ORD-{timestamp}-{random}`
- Order status can be: `pending`, `processing`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If orders aren't saving:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Ensure user is authenticated

For backend issues:
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify JWT_SECRET is set
3. Check backend console for errors
